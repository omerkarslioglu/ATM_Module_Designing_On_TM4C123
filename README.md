# ATM_Module_Designing_On_TM4C123
Purpose : Designning an ATM module by programming the microprocessor according to the desired criteria. While designing the interface of this module, it is envisaged to use UART serial communication intensively and to use keypad to provide external communication between the user and ATM.

# CONNECTIONS

I made the ROWs connections as follows:
R1 - R4 => PD0-PD3
I made the COLUMNs connections as follows:
C1-C3 => PC5-PC7

USB TTL CONVERTER :

I connected the USB TTL Converter's GND to
the launch pad's GND.
I made the other pins connections as follows:
RX => PE5
TX => PE4

# Conclusion

While doing the project, I used the possibilities offered by the c
language very well. For example , I used pointer to define as string ,
another example , I converted a string type variable to integer using atoi()
function . I have used many features like this. In this way, I feel that my
level in the c language has increased a little more.
After successfully completing my project, I prepared my report and
video. I've always had an interest in embedded systems. That's why I really
like to do something in this field. While programming the TM4C123 MCU, I
benefited from a lot of the information I learned in the course and
reinforced my knowledge. I gained more technical knowledge and
experience about UART serial communication. At the same time , I feel
that I have gained more experience with other peripherals such as system
timers , GPIO . I had done research on how to write more analytic
algorithms for hardware such as keypads at the first date of the project.
Actually, I learned that it has a very simple logic and I wrote and
presented my algorithm, which I explained in detail in the Keypad section.
This project gave me a lot of experience and knowledge about mcu
programming and embedded system in general .
